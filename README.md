Hi, I'm Moin and I'm learning how to code.  I'm just working through the JavaScript course on CodeAcademy and am hoping to earn 5kyu on CodeWars within the next month to apply for the Founders&Coders course.  I'll be working solidly for the next month or so, as many hours as I can per day - wish me luck!
